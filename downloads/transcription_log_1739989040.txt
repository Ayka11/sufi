[2025-02-19 19:23:39] Thank you small decisions you make each day developing.
[2025-02-19 19:23:48] One of the most powerful ways you can guarantee your success is by educating yourself.
[2025-02-19 19:23:58] Sky 1:00 Every single day is an opportunity.
[2025-02-19 19:24:05] You with the tools you need to take.
[2025-02-19 19:24:12] But here's the key this kind of education just about what you learned.
[2025-02-19 19:24:17] To see them at the wrong time.
[2025-02-19 19:24:40] We're going to look at why it's so important to make learning a daily matter, how it can change your lives forever when you choose to educate yourself.
[2025-02-19 19:25:10] You're not just passing, you're building the foundation for a future you will be proud of. The most successful people in the world didn't get there by sitting idle or waiting for things to come to them. They got there by being committed to constant improvement. So stay with me until the end, because what you're about to learn could be the key to unlocking your fullest potential. This isn't just about gaining knowledge, It's about transforming your life, gaining the confidence to face challenges, and putting yourself in a position to create the future you always wanted.
[2025-02-19 19:25:40] Keep walking because the journey of 1000 steps begins with the decision to educate yourself. And I'll show you exactly how to make that decision #1 your mind is a garden plant wisely. Your mind is working every second of every day right now. It's either working for you or against you. And here's the truth. Most people never take control of their own mind. They don't decide what to feed. They don't filter what gets in. They let the world decide for them. The news, Social media.
[2025-02-19 19:26:10] Random conversations, gossip, negativity, whatever is around them, that's what they consider. And then they measure why they feel stuck, unmotivated, or lost. But you, you're here because you want more. You want to grow, you want to change. And let me tell you something. The moment you take charge of your mind, everything changes. Your mind is like A and whatever you plant in it, whatever you water, whatever you nurture, that's what will grow if you plant.
[2025-02-19 19:26:14] You get If you plant strong, healthy seeds, you get a.
[2025-02-19 19:26:40] Beautiful Harvest. Think about that. Every thought you entertain, every book you read, every conversation you have, every video you watch, it's all shaping. It's either pushing you towards success or pulling you away. And if you don't take control of what goes in, don't be surprised when your results in life don't change. You can't grow an orchard of success while planting seeds of doubt.
[2025-02-19 19:26:55] Negativity. It doesn't work that way. I remember a time in my life when I didn't get this. I was just going through the motions, doing what everyone else was doing. Now let me tell you, that's a dangerous way to live. If you follow the code, you'll end up where the crowd ends up.
[2025-02-19 19:27:12] Crowd. They're broke, they're stressed, they're stuck in cycles. They can't break out. But the moment I started filtering what I allowed into my mind, my life shift. I stopped spending time with people, only talked about properties and never I stopped reading.
[2025-02-19 19:27:42] Things that didn't add value to my life. I stopped wasting time on things that weren't. Instead, I started filling my mind with knowledge, with ideas, strategists. I started surrounding myself with people who were ahead of me, people who had wisdom to share. And let me tell you, the results were incredible. Now let's talk about you because this isn't just about theory. This is about you taking action to ask yourself, what are you planting in your mind every single day? Are you feeding it with?
[2025-02-19 19:28:09] Are you choosing to read to learn studies or are you learning distractions, excuses and negativity run your life. Some people say I don't have time to read, but they have time for TV. They have time for enrolling endlessly on social media. They have time for meaningless conversation. So it's not about time, it's about priorities.
[2025-02-19 19:28:18] If you don't make your own heroes, life will make sure you say exactly where that's not, and it's not meant to discourage you.
[2025-02-19 19:28:21] OK.
[2025-02-19 19:28:40] What are you listening to? What are you reading? Who are you?
[2025-02-19 19:28:42] Whether you realize it.
[2025-02-19 19:28:50] If you're always useless information.
[2025-02-19 19:29:09] Second replacement. Start small, Green something valuable every day, even if it's just for 10 minutes. Listen to something I've educate you. Have conversations that challenge your This isn't about overnight transportation, it's about.
[2025-02-19 19:29:30] Your mind, like your life, depends on it because it does. What negativity tries to creep in? Shut it down when down tries to take over some place in with action when people around you try to pull you back. Habits. Remind yourself where you're not here to stay the same, you're here to.
[2025-02-19 19:29:52] Now I know what some of you might be thinking, channels. What if I've already learned too much negativity? What if I've already wasted years planting the wrong seeds? Let me tell you something. It's never too late to change. The best time to start was years ago. The second best time right now.
[2025-02-19 19:29:55] What did you?
[2025-02-19 19:30:00] Were done letting the world control your mind. That's the second flight starts to change.
[2025-02-19 19:30:13] So here's my challenge for the next 30 days. Commence feeding your mind with every day to read something to value. Cut out one negative happen. You see it?
[2025-02-19 19:43:26] Your thoughts will change, your energy will change, your confidence will grow, the results will improve. And you'll look back and wonder why you didn't start soon. Because here's the truth. The greatest investment will ever make is in your own mind. The people who succeed. The people who live fulfilled lives. The people who achieve.
[2025-02-19 19:43:53] Dreams, they're the ones who took their education into their own hands. They didn't wait for someone else to teach them. They didn't let circumstances decide for them. They made the decision to educate themselves every single day. And that's the decision I want you to make today. No more letting the world plant weed in your life. No more waiting for the right time. No more excuses. Take control, plant wisely, and watch your life transform #2.
[2025-02-19 19:43:58] Look on two you Whoopi go, go where you are, OK?
[2025-02-19 19:44:13] A single day, whether you like it or not. The question is, are you changing with? Are you growing, adapting and learning? There's no legitimate things will work out. So let me tell you something.
[2025-02-19 19:44:30] There can only be legitimate experience. So who did it? Father of mine. Oh yeah. Knowledge. Then you're following the most places back. You want to buy tomorrow? That guy.
[2025-02-19 19:44:40] 
[2025-02-19 19:45:00] 
[2025-02-19 19:45:08] Just rely on what they were talking about. They took control of their.
[2025-02-19 19:45:12] Daily habit.
[2025-02-19 19:45:29] Increase your income. Increase your knowledge. If you want to change your circumstances, change what you know. The more you grow, the more doors open for you.
[2025-02-19 19:45:43] If you take it back to work, they think learning, issue attention, they think that we are putting on the problem Malaysia. That's why they struggle. They're waiting for someone to come along and give them a raise.
[2025-02-19 19:46:13] Give them a promotion, give them an opportunity. But the world doesn't work like that. You don't get rewarded for time served, you get rewarded for value created. And the only way to create more value is to learn more. Think about this. Two people start the same job on the same day. One spends years just doing what they're told, never improving, never growing. The other spends those same years learning everything they can, studying their industry, developing new skills.
[2025-02-19 19:46:18] Understanding how to become more efficient, more effective.
[2025-02-19 19:46:41] Who do you think is going to hurt? Have more control over their life. It's obvious. Now let's talk about you. Because this isn't just about knowing the truth, it's about acting on it. You have a choice. You can continue living the way you've always lived, doing the same things, getting the same results. Or you can make the decision today to take control of your own education.
[2025-02-19 19:47:11] And no, I don't mean going back to school. I mean real world education, the kind that makes a difference, the kind that actually increases your income, improves your mindset, and helps you create a life that you want. I mean reading books that challenge your thinking. I mean listening to people who are already where you want to be. I mean studying success like it's your job. Because guess what? It is your job. If you want to succeed, if you want to break out of mediocrity, then learning is your responsibility.
[2025-02-19 19:47:40] Some people say no, but Jim, I don't have time to read. I don't have time to study. And let me be real, that's just an excuse. Because the truth is, you have time for whatever. You make a priority. If you have time for TV, you have time to. If you have time to scroll through social media, you have time to learn something valuable. The problem isn't time. The problem is commitment. If something matters to you, you'll make time for it. Let me give you a challenge.
[2025-02-19 19:48:06] Starting today, commit to learning something new every single day. Just 30 minutes. That's it. Read 10 pages of a good book. Listen to an audio book in the car. Watch an interview with someone who has the results you want. Just do something that adds value to your mind. Because when you do this consistently, your life will start to change. You'll start to think differently. You'll start to see opportunities that you never saw before.
[2025-02-19 19:48:14] And let me tell you, when you become the kind of person who is constantly learning, constantly improving, constantly leveling up, you become unstoppable.
[2025-02-19 19:48:45] You stop waiting for opportunities because you create. You stop hoping for success because you build. And when you do that, the world takes notice. People will want to work with you, they'll want to invest in you. They'll want to give you opportunities because you have something most people don't, knowledge and the discipline. So ask yourself, what are you learning right now that's making you better? What skills are you developing that are increasing your value? What knowledge are you acquiring that's helping you move forward?
[2025-02-19 19:49:04] If you don't have an answer, then today is the day to start. Because the more you learn, the more you earn. That's the rule. That's how the world works. You don't have to be the smartest person in the room. You just have to be the person who never stops. Because when you commit to lifelong education, when you dedicate.
[2025-02-19 19:49:14] No limits to what you can achieve. The question is, are you willing to do what it takes? If the answer is yes, then start today because your future starts now.
[2025-02-19 19:49:45] #3 Self education is the key to freedom. It's not just about learning new things, it's about gaining the freedom to choose your life. When you take charge of your own learning, you begin to break free from the constraints that hold others back. You stop relying on someone else to tell you what to do, how to think, or what you're capable of. The key to your freedom lies in your ability to educate yourself, to build your own knowledge and skills, and to grow outside.
[2025-02-19 19:50:14] Traditional education. See, most people think freedom comes from the ability to make choices. But here's the truth. Freedom doesn't come from making random choices. It comes from making informed choices. And the only way to make informed choices is through education. The more you learn, the more you understand about how the world works, about the opportunities around you, and most importantly, about yourself, you begin to see the full spectrum of what's possible.
[2025-02-19 19:50:22] And that is the ultimate freedom. Self education is one of the most powerful tools you can use to change your life. Think about it, everything you have.
[2025-02-19 19:50:53] Everything you've achieved and everything you will achieve all starts with knowledge. If you want to earn more, you need to know more. If you want to be healthier, you need to understand your body. If you want better relationships, you need to learn the dynamics of human connection. Every single area of your life can be improved with the right knowledge, and the only person responsible for gaining that knowledge is you. That's the difference between those who settle for mediocrity and those who build extraordinary lives, the people who thrive.
[2025-02-19 19:51:23] Understand that their future is created by what they choose to learn and apply today. Those who are content to rely on what they were taught in school or what they were told by others are always one step behind always reacting to life rather than proactively shaping it. And it's not because they don't have potential, it's because they haven't taken control of their education. Look around you. The world is filled with people who have access to the same resources, the same information, the same opportunities.
[2025-02-19 19:51:53] But what sets the successful apart from the rest is their dedication to self education. You see, when you take your education into your own hands, you step into your power. You stop waiting for someone to give you permission to succeed. You stop relying on luck, on timing, or on chance. You become the architect of your own future. The key to building a life of freedom isn't in waiting for someone to hand it to you. It's in choosing to develop the mindset, the skills and the knowledge that will move you forward. It's about.
[2025-02-19 19:52:22] Actively seeking out the information that can help you unlock your potential. It's about making a decision that you will never stop learning, never stop growing, and never stop evolving. Let me give you an example. Think about someone who wants to start a business. They have a dream, they have an idea, but what happens next? They can even jump in without any knowledge and hope it works out where they can educate themselves on how to run a business, how to manage finances, how to market effectively.
[2025-02-19 19:52:32] How to lead people? Yeah, that's not give themselves a much greater chance, though. The difference is in the level of education they're willing to invest in.
[2025-02-19 19:52:43] How they spend their time, How they.
[2025-02-19 19:52:53] How they live their lives, their lives. But it doesn't just apply to business. Think about help. If you want to be healthier, you can rely on the advice of others.
[2025-02-19 19:52:56] Diet trends or you can enjoy yourself on fitness.
[2025-02-19 19:53:16] On how your body works. When you understand what you need to eat, how to exercise, and how to take care of your mental and emotional health, you gain the freedom to take control of your body. You don't have to wait for a doctor or a trainer to tell you what to do. You can make informed choices every single day. The more you know.
[2025-02-19 19:53:30] Choose the life you want to live. What I'm telling you is this, self education is your ticket to freedom. It's the one thing no one can take away from you. When you build a habit of learning, you create a mindset that will serve you for the rest of your life.
[2025-02-19 19:54:00] You build a life where you are in control, where you make the rules, where you set the course, and where you choose your own destiny. Now, I know that for many people, the idea of self education might feel overwhelming. You might think, where do I start or how do I make the time? The truth is, it's not as complicated as you think. It doesn't take hours of study every day or a degree in a specific field. It takes small, consistent actions. It's about reading a few pages of a book each day. It's about listening.
[2025-02-19 19:54:30] Into podcasts that teach you something new it's about taking the time to learn a new skill or improve an existing 1 and over time, these small efforts compound into massive results but here's the thing you have to start you have to take that first step you can't wait for someone to give you permission to learn you can't wait for the perfect time to start The perfect time is that the moment you decide to take control of your own education is the moment you begin to unlock yourself education is also.
[2025-02-19 19:54:58] About being resourceful. You don't need a fancy school or expensive classes to get started. There are books, videos, podcasts, and online resources that give you the knowledge you need to start building the life you want. You have access to everything you need right now. What matters is your willingness to take action. What matters is your commitment to growing every single day. And here's the most important part. Education doesn't stop.
[2025-02-19 19:55:06] You have to keep going. It's a lifelong journey. Every day is an opportunity to learn something new, to refine your skills.
[2025-02-19 19:55:36] To become a better version of yourself. And as you do this, you'll find that your freedom expands. You'll have more choices, more opportunities and more control over your future. So if you want freedom, if you want to live a life that's truly your own, make self education a priority. Invest in yourself. Commit to learning something new every single day. You'll be amazed at how much your life will change and how much power you'll have to shape your own destiny. The key to freedom is in your hands all.
[2025-02-19 19:56:02] Have to do is reach out and grab it #4 success leaves clues. Follow the right characters. Success isn't something that just happens overnight. It doesn't appear out of thin air, nor does it come by accident. Success leaves clues. The people who achieve great things in this world, those who build empires, create lasting legacies, and live life on their own terms.
[2025-02-19 19:56:12] Didn't just stumble upon success, They studied it. They learned from those who came before them. They followed the paths already laid out by others who had achieved the same.
[2025-02-19 19:56:42] And that's something most people overlook. They think success is a secret, something elusive or reserved for a select few. But the truth is, success is far less of a mystery than people think. It's a pattern. It's a set of steps that anyone can follow if they're willing to look for the clues. The most successful people don't have some magical advantage over you. They don't have some hidden power that you don't have access to. What they have is a road map. A road map built by the.
[2025-02-19 19:57:12] This is about this by the mistakes and triumphs of people who went before them. These people understood that success is a result of a series of decisions, habits, and actions. And those decisions and actions can be learned. They're not a random series of events. They're the result of someone following this crisis. Think about the greatest minds in history. They all had mentors. They all studied others who had done what they wanted to do. They looked for patterns and success. They asked questions.
[2025-02-19 19:57:42] Do you want that to understand? And then they applied that knowledge. It's not about inventing the wheel, It's about finding the wheels that work and learning how to make them spin in your own life. One of the best ways to ensure your success is to find someone who's already been where you want to go and learn from them. It's that simple. Find a mentor. Find someone whose life you admire, whose success you can look up to and learn from their journey.
[2025-02-19 19:58:11] What they did to get where they are. It's that straightforward. Most people think they have to figure everything out on their own, but you don't have to. You don't have to reinvent the wheel. In fact, reinventing the wheel is one of the most exhausting and inefficient things you can do. Instead, learn from someone who's already figured it out. Understand their journey. See what they did right, and learn from the mistakes they made along the way. There's no need to repeat those mistakes.
[2025-02-19 19:58:21] When someone else has already gone through them. When you begin to look at success this way through the lens of learning from others, you shift your perspective. Success isn't this far off.
[2025-02-19 20:03:34] No longer out here trying to figure things out in isolation. Instead, you're part of a bigger picture, learning from those who have already walked the path and laid the foundation for you to follow. And as you follow their example, you'll start to see your own success begin to unfold. Because the principles of success apply to everyone, regardless of their background, their resources, or their circumstances.
[2025-02-19 20:03:35] The only thing that separates you from success.
[2025-02-19 20:04:28] Is your willingness to learn from those who have already achieved it. Here's the thing. You don't have to spend your life struggling to get ahead. You don't have to make all the mistakes yourself. You don't have to waste time trying to figure everything out on your own. You have the opportunity to learn from the very best. The people who have already achieved what you want to achieve. The ones who have already built the life you want to live. They're out there. They've written books, they've made speeches, they've created videos.
[2025-02-19 20:04:39] They shared their knowledge. All you have to do is show up and be willing to listen. This is the power of mentorship and learning from those who have been successful. It's not about taking shortcuts. It's about learning from the experiences of others and avoiding the mistakes they make. It's about standing on the shoulders of giants. And when you choose to learn from others, you shorten the time it takes to reach your own goals. You create your own success much faster. You don't have to reinvent the process.
[2025-02-19 20:04:39] You just have to apply the lessons.
